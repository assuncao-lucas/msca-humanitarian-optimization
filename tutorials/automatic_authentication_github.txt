* to make IRACE variables global:

add these to: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile:
# Replace <IRACE_HOME> with the irace installation path
export IRACE_HOME=/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/irace
export PATH=${IRACE_HOME}/bin/:$PATH
# Tell R where to find R_LIBS_USER
# Use the following line only if local installation was forced
export R_LIBS=${R_LIBS_USER}:${R_LIBS}
